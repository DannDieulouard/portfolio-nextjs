Nobody said it was easy, said Coldplay?
Well, they were right.

In the competitive world of tech, 32-year-old me embarked on an unconventional journey to become a web developer. My goal: to secure an apprenticeship that would launch a new career.

##  The Spark and Preparation

After discovering a passion for web development, I spent months building a foundation through online courses and personal projects. With a basic portfolio in hand, I hope to set out to find an apprenticeship that would elevate my skills to a professional level.

##  The Apprenticeship Hunt Begins

My search for an apprenticeship was methodical and multifaceted:

Online Job Boards: I scoured platforms like Indeed, LinkedIn, and specialized tech job boards daily. I set up alerts for keywords like "web developer apprentice" and "junior developer program."

Company Websites: I researched tech companies known for their apprenticeship programs, regularly checking their career pages for openings.

Networking Events: I attended local tech meetups mostly. At each event, I made it a point to connect with at least five new people, focusing on those already working in web development.

Social Media Outreach: I leveraged Twitter and LinkedIn to follow companies and developers. I engaged in discussions, shared my learning journey, and occasionally reached out directly to developers for advice.

Cold Emailing: I compiled a list of small to medium-sized tech companies in my target cities and sent personalized emails expressing my interest in apprenticeship opportunities, even if none were advertised.

Tailored Applications: For each opportunity, I customized my resume and cover letter, emphasizing how my unconventional background could bring fresh perspectives to the team.

## Lessons Learned
My apprenticeship search taught me valuable lessons:

- Persistence and adaptability are key in a competitive field.

- Building a network is as important as building technical skills.

- Showcasing practical skills through projects can outweigh formal education.

- Targeting the right companies (in this case, startups open to non-traditional candidates) can make all the difference.

Will I make it through ? That is all I can wish for this adventure!

**Fingers crossed.**
