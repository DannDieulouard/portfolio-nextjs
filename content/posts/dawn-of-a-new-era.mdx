In the heart of Bordeaux, a unique educational experience is making waves in the tech world. Known as "La Piscine" (The Pool), this intensive program is not your typical coding bootcamp. It's a grueling, month-long immersion that serves as both an entrance exam and a baptism by fire for aspiring programmers. This is my story, as a new 32-year-old aspiring web developer, as I take my first plunge into the world of coding at La Piscine.

## The Deep End

It's 9:30 AM on a Monday, and I stand nervously in front of the sleek, modern building that houses La Piscine. I am one of those hopefuls who have been selected to participate in this program. The air buzzes with a mixture of excitement and apprehension as students from diverse backgrounds – recent high school graduates, career changers, and self-taught coding enthusiasts – gather for orientation.

## The first Splash 

After a playful first day to discover each other, the big jump is soon to come.

As the second day starts, me and my fellow comrades (swimmers) are immediately thrust into the deep end. There are no really true helping, no lectures, and no hand-holding. Instead, we're presented with a series of increasingly complex algorythmic challenges and left to figure things out on our own.

## Sink or Swim ?

Hopefully our class of 12 people will make it throough until graduation. 

I already made friends with my peers and we all hope to succeed in this new career !
